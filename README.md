In this project, the surface climate in Brazil is visualized using the dataset available on Kaggle [Climate Weather Surface of Brazil - Hourly](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PROPPG-PPG/hourly-weather-surface-brazil-southeast-region). For this purpose, eight weather stations from each of the five regions (Central West, North, Northeast, South, Southeast) that are evenly spreaded across the country are selected and visualized.
